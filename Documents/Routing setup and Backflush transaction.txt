Objective

In order to successfully complete backflush transaction several setup steps need to be made.

Process Steps

To perform backflush it is required to create Employee and Department. 
Employee Create/ Employee Modify: 36.1.7.1 / 36.1.7.2

Here it is enough to create only one employee. No other fields are required to be filled.
Should be created already by G2 team





Department Maintenance: 14.1
Here it is enough to create one department for BF only. No other fields are required to be filled.
Should be created already by G2 team



Work Center Maintenance: 14.5

For backflush separate work center has to be created: BK
To this work center you need to link previously created Department (14.1) 
Should be created already by G2 team



Standard Operation Maintenance: 14.9

One standard operation must be created in the system with code 999.
It must me setup as 100% Yield Percentage and checked as Milestone Operation.
Also previously created Work Center has to be linked to 999 operation

Routing Maintenance: 14.13.1

When creating default routing following data should be setup:
- Standard Operation should be assigned

- Routing Code (NEW Requirement) - must be assigned to each part that is being produced.


Production line maintenance: 18.22.1.1 - IMPORTANT
