Using Pivot table for analysis
By using the Pivot table function in Excel you can make an analysis of these data (you can find the Pivot table function in the 'Data' tab). This tool enables you to make reports according to your needs from the raw data you see below. This can be used for finding out what claims can be made towards out customer and what our suppliers can claim to us.



By dragging the field buttons to the column and row you can construct you own Matrix. 

For example: when you want to have an overview from the forecasted cumulative figures drag the following items to the page: Interval (weekly or monthly), Item, Creation_week, Forecast_week and Cum_qty. See the following picture how to do this.

Important additional information

With the item 'Forecast_week' there is sometimes the monthly forecast mentioned as well. You can check this by looking at the column 'Interval' where 'W' of weekly or 'M' of monthly is described.



You can do exactly the same when you want to have an overview of individual orders made. Just replace Cum_qty with Forecast_qty_1.


From these matrixes you can make graphs in which deviations in planning for a particular item or a whole group. 
You can add additional filters for better analysis of the data (year, sender):



These data can be used for negotiating purposes and analysis. You can compare the planning from your customer with your planning after an MRP-run towards your suppliers to find out what influence the settings of your QAD system have on the demand further down the Supply Chain.
